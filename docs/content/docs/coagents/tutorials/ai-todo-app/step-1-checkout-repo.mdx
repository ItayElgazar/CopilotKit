<Steps>
<Step>
### Checkout the repository
We'll begin by checking out the base code of the travel app. The starting code is hosted in the `CopilotKit` repo, under the `examples/coagents-travel` directory.

```shell
git clone -b coagents-travel-tutorial-start https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit.git
cd examples/coagents-travel
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Install dependencies

There are two main folders in this repo:
- `ui`: This is the NextJS app that we'll be integrating the co-agent into.
- `agent`: This is the agent itself, written in Python. We'll talk more about this later, but for now just ignore it.

First, navigate into the `ui` folder:

```shell
cd ui
```

Once there, install the dependencies by running:

```shell
npm install
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Start the project

Now, you are ready to start the project by running:

```shell
npm run dev
```

You should be able to go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the travel app. Feel free to play around with the app to get a feel for it.

Next, let's understand the LangGraph agent and how it works.
